Changelist HO! 1.432
====================
- Hattrick Organizer now requires Java 1.6 (aka JRE6). Open JDK supports older operating systems that oracle does not. Please update your Java installation if needed.

- Player subskills
	. Training is now minute based. Correct counting only for matches downloaded in 1.431 or later.
		It is possible to delete your own matches by the db cleanup tool, and download them again by
		archive options in download. After this a full subskill recalculation could be interesting.
	. Osmosis training has been added. A small training effect for all players on the field.
	. Added green background for 100% trainees and yellow for 50% trainees in training prediction (white background for osmosis training).
	. Use subskill overflow for training prediction to avoid rounding errors hiding coach and assitant number changes effects.
	. The skill level effect on training has been adjusted.
	. Skill drops due to age at 30 or above, or at skills of 16 or above is in as a first version.
		Speeds will require more or less tuning.
	. Training offset has been removed, and been replaced with an option to adjust the subskill directly.

- Team Analyzer
	. All update restrictions have been removed, including favorite teams.
	. Update will now download the matches to fill out your autofilter request, or the 30 last opponent matches if a manual filter is selected.
	. Tournament opponents are in, and so are tournament matches.
	. Auto filter options are now saved when you analyze, and should reappear that way until changed.
	. Auto filter options for tournament and masters matches.
	. Fixed bug that renaming team after the last league match prevented analyzing matches before name changes.

- Match order uploads
	. The option to upload match orders to Hattrick have been added.
	. This is a Hattrick supporter feature, and non-supporters will find the upload button inactive.
	. The lineup tab now has its own tabs, the new ones are:
		. Lineup - the old one.
		. Match orders - a place to set and view match orders.
		. Penalty takers - a place to view and set the penalty shooter list.
		. Upload/Download - a place to upload and download orders to and from specific matches.

- Special Events
	. got a lot of improvments (esp. the filter)

- Lazy initialization/refresh 
	. The content of each tab is now loaded not before the tab is opened for the first time. Analogous, 
	  if the content of a tab needs to be refreshed, it is only refreshed if the tab is currently showing. 
	  If it's not showing, it will be refreshed as soon as it gets shown. This works (at the moment) for 
	  all tabs except lineup, players, transfers. Lazy initialization/refresh will noticeable (depending 
	  on the number of modules you are using) decrease startup time and reduce the memory footprint of the application.

- Added Tournament matches.
- New icon and startup screen.
- Moved intern help texts and from external files to our wiki page (https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ho1/wiki/Manual) and link to it in the menu.

- Seat distribution is shown in arena section of Statistics tab.
- Stadium prices HT-adapted (7/10/19/35).
- Copying ratings to the clipboard in HT-ML table format now centres all ratings in the table.
- Lowered Overcrowding penalty for lineups with 3 forwards. Attack ratings with 3 forwards should now be closer to the reality.
- TS Forecast Module should now display confidence at the correct level.
- TS Forecast Module: Fixed Loepi curve with a new database, enabled TS and confidence graphs by default and detect if team is still in cup or has qualifiers.
- Maintain Captain and Set piece taker when the line up is reversed.
- The old penalty shooter button is gone. Look for the new tab instead.
- Added ability to reset all positional orders in the line up tab.
- Calculate loyalty and homegrownbonus for set pieces and penalty takers.
- Fixed IFA module not to download matches before the user got the team.
