In 2394 a new .dmg was committed.
this was created in the following way.

Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/286419/how-to-build-a-dmg-mac-os-x-file-on-a-non-mac-platform

A couple of hfs packages are needed. They are complained about if you try without.

From the above page>

dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/foo.dmg bs=1M count=64
mkfs.hfsplus -v ThisIsFoo /tmp/foo.dmg

This creates a dmg file (in this case 64M) that can be mounted on a mac. It can also be mounted on linux, 
with something like

mount -o loop /tmp/foo.dmg /mnt/foo

Alternatively with type set:

mount -o loop -t hfsplus image.dmg /path/to/directory/you/want

The HO template was not named ThisIsFoo, but HO... It is also 40M, not 64. The old was 15M.

It was mounted, as was the old, and the content of the old .dmg was copied across.

The ant script uses this template to create the .dmg installer. It mounts it, copies the
HO content inside, and unmounts, renames, and gzips. The above mentioned copying after creating the
dmg should copy across the necessary installer structures, but they are also present in this
folder. They may or may not be copied by ant (I have not checked).
